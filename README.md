# EscapeFromFog

![](resources/demo.gif)

Attempt at a 2.5 dimensional video game engine using mostly OpenGL and C++.
The game is imspired by the class Wolfenstein 3D by Id Software.
Also draws inspiration from [here](https://github.com/BennyQBD/Wolfenstein3DClone).

## Stuff To Do:
 - Add a pause state
 - Add combat
 - Add particle system (especially for bullets).
 - Add more proc-gen (item, enemy placement, and the level itself)
 - A-star pathfinding
 - Item effects and proper post-processing
 - Use OpenGL instance rendering for tiles on the level
 - Render to cube map to do cool stuff (julia fractal, scrolling terminal text)
 - jumping?
 - Normal mapping on levels
 - Better sound / music / textures
 - Command pattern for user input
