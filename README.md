# ShooterGame

![](resources/demo.gif)

Attempt at a 2.5 dimensional video game engine using mostly OpenGL and C++. <br />
The game is imspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D first-person shooter by Id Software in the 90's. <br />
It also draws inspiration from [BennyBox's Wolfenstein 3D clone](https://github.com/BennyQBD/Wolfenstein3DClone). <br />

## Stuff To Do:
 - Add a pause state
 - Add combat (killing)
 - Add particle system (especially for bullets).
 - Asynchronously generate levels (the 2D array)
 - A-star pathfinding for enemies
 - Item effects (powerups)
 - Use OpenGL instance rendering for tiles on the level
 - Render to textures
 - Boss levels
 - Normal mapping on levels
 - 3D spatialization for sound
 - Command pattern for user input (add joystick inputs)
